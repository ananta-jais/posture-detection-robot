# Posture Detection Robot

## 📌 Overview
A computer vision-based system designed to detect incorrect sitting posture in real time and provide feedback alerts. Built as part of a class team project as an aid for preventive health monitoring with an aim to refine for contact sports.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, Teachable Machine, Embedded Systems (Arduino)

## ✨ Features
• Real-time posture analysis  
• Threshold-based alert mechanism (buzzer/LCD trigger)  
• Evaluated performance during testing with multiple participants  

## 🔮 Future Improvements
• Better accuracy using ML pose estimation  
• Mobile integration for notifications
• Full-body movement monitoring for contact sports
